                            A cough thta happens once in a while is common. It helps clear mucus from your lungs and prevents infection. But a cough that lasts for weeks is usually due to a health concern and might be either of the following reasons: <br><br>
                            Asthma-  An asthma-related cough might be seasonal, often emerging after a respiratory infection. It can also worsen with exposure to cold air, certain chemicals, or fragrances. In a type of asthma called cough-variant asthma, coughing is the primary symptom.  <br>

                            Postnasal drip- When your nose or sinuses produce extra mucus, it can drip down the back of your throat and cause you to cough. This condition also is called upper airway cough syndrome. <br>

                            Infections- A cough can last long after other symptoms of pneumonia, flu, a cold or another infection of the upper respiratory tract have gone away. A common cause of a chronic cough in adults — but one that often isn't recognized — is whooping cough.  <br>
